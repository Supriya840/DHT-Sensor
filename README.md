# DHT-Sensor

Monitoring Temperature and Humidity using DHT sensor 
Hardware: 
S.No  Component Name 
1.    Arduino Uno 
2.    DHT sensor 
3.    Resistors 
Software: Arduino IDE 

Setup:

Tools --> Manage Libraries --> type DHT11--> select Adafruit Library --> select recent version and install / Update

There are 2 versions for the code, first where we are taking potentiometer to increase or decrease the humidity in tinkercad simulation as tinkercad doesn't have DHT sensor and the second one where we are running the code of DHT sensor on arduino ide
